# Calculator

## Introduction

This calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math
operators you typically find on simple calculators (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). You are also able to negate numbers and represent percent values. You can find a live preview
of this calculator app [here](https://williamandrews2.github.io/calculator/).

## How it works

A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number.
For example, 3 + 5. There will be three variables for each of the parts of a calculator
operation. These will be updated in the calculator's display and will be constantly updated
as the calculation gets longer. 

## Known issues
