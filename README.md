# Calculator

## Introduction

This calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math
operators you typically find on simple calculators (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division).

## How it works

A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number.
For example, 3 + 5. There will be three variables for each of the part of a calculator
operation. These will be updated in the calculator's display.
